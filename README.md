# Mobile App Landing Page
(FRONT-END DEV CODE CHALLENGE)

Hi! This is the first project, of many projects, I hope, that I develop for **ArcTouch**. At present, as an evaluation modality to apply the vacancy. I am happy for the opportunity and as I was guided in the interview, I used the most pure and simple codification possible, structuring and creating the codes at hand.


# Files

All the files presented here were developed in order to fulfill the proposed challenge, and these can be worked and established in repository through the use of **BOWER**.

## Structure

I used standard Bower.io structuring, where the "assets" folder has all the necessary files and project complements. I used a stable version of frameworks to ensure that it is compatible with most platforms and devices.

## Responsive and dynamic

The project was all developed with responsiveness in mind and respecting the limits and structures of the devices' viewport.

## View the live version

To facilitate the evaluation process, I have committed the files here to **GITHUB** but you can view the same version through the **link: http://cwbra.com/projetos/arctouch/** using the following credentials:

> USERNAME: **arctouch**

> PASSWORD: **arctouch**

# Synchronization

- Project link on GitHub: https://github.com/verlingue/ArcTouch-Evaluation/tree/craze-evaluation-jan18

## Downloading the ZIP Package

To use the **project**, simply access the link below, from GITHUB and download the **ZIP** in the 'Packages' folder, in the version of your choice: https://github.com/verlingue/ArcTouch-Evaluation/tree/craze-evaluation-jan18/package

## Synchronize by Bower

You only need to download the following files:

 - index.html
 - bower.json
 - .bowerrc

From inside the folder 'assets':

 - fonts (folder complete)
 - images (folder complete)
 - styles (folder complete)
 - scripts (only the '.js' files outside the folders)

Once *done*, just open the **console** (command prompt) at the **root of the project** and run the *'sudo bower install'* command.

> **Note:** Syncing in this way allows you to use less traffic, because if you already have the version of the libraries on your machine it will load it into the project and it will be much faster to download.

# Conclusions

Final conclusions of the project, as requested, I created the project based on the PSD file provided, with all the required features, and as a factor of innovation, I highlight the effective use of CSS for many functions that applied to JavaScript, just as a alternative and less scripts consuming, allowing the project in certain devices and / or clients.

The Client Testimonial Slider automatically transitions every 4 seconds, stopping the transition loop as soon as the user interacts with it.

I created the fully adjustable and responsive model for mobile devices.
